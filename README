In Ivan's MiniSpec and Capybara video what were the bash commands like '!826' doing?

Why is the HomeController neccessary when it just inherits from ApplicationController? I see the can_access_home_test.rb needs it from the tests, but I'm not sure why.

Overall, a pretty challenging project, the video tutorial was a life saver honestly.
